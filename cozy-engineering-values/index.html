					<h1>Solve Problems</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>The work we choose to do solves problems with the purpose of bringing peace of mind.</li>
						<li>Problems are identified by evaluating the needs of Cozyans and our customers.</li>
						<li>Before you can determine the best solution, you need to fully understand the problem—do research, ask questions, and get feedback.</li>
						<li>If you start exploring the solution to a problem, and encounter roadblocks or setbacks, reevaluate—nothing is set in stone, and deeper perspective often shifts priorities over time.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Iterate often</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Seek the simplest possible solution.</li>
						<li>Keep momentum going and accept anything can be changed later.</li>
						<li>Everything can always be improved—seek out ways to make our work better, and make it happen.</li>
						<li>Foster a sense of non-attachment to a final destination, or final product. There will always be work to do, and we share determination to continually do better.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Put people first</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Empowerment of everyone on the team, and effective collaboration are paramount.</li>
						<li>Treat effective communication as an invaluable skill, and proactively build relationships with your team.</li>
						<li>There are no stupid questions, just learning opportunities. Always encourage people to ask questions, and respond to any asks with respect.</li>
						<li>If a process or policy exists that doesn’t serve everyone, it should be reconsidered and revised.</li>
						<li>Our customers are real people, and should be at the forefront of our minds in our work—our goal is to serve them as best as we can.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Share ownership</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Every single person at Cozy shares responsibility for the success of our product.</li>
						<li>Work toward understanding our entire application. Participate in conve`rsations, provide feedback, and do code reviews across all areas of the app.</li>
						<li>Ask “Why?” and “How?” as often as needed to deepen understanding.</li>`
						<li>Have conversations with folks in other departments, and leverage the coll`ective knowledge of everyone at the company.</li>
						<li>Take responsibility for both your success, as well as` your mistakes.</li>
						<li>Acknowledge and celebrate the success of others.</li>
